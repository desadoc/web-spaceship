A proof of concept for a game idea that I had, a rpg-like game that looks like a simple web site. In this case it has simulation and survival elements too. But this is really only a proof of concept, and mostly for the technological part. It uses React, Redux and Redux-Saga. No backend.

To get it started, the usual suspect:

### `yarn start`

## What is Special About This?

For the game part, I think it's an interesting idea, because web pages favor narrative and precise interactions.

Looking at the code, it has an action that acts like a game update loop, it's emmitted at regular intervals, and can be enabled or paused, allowing for a more strategical gameplay.
